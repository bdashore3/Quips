# Quips

A local microblogging journal for iOS and MacCatalyst

## What is this for?

Twitter is a really nice service with a simple microblogging format, but has been poisoned over the years by the community surrounding it. There are many twitter clones out there, but they all have some sort of toxicity in the community.

So here was the idea. Many people (including myself) use Twitter as sort of a journal to write random thoughts down. If the community is the bad part of Twitter, why not completely get rid of it?

Quips was born as a concept project to use SwiftUI's new iOS 16 APIs and as a place for me to locally journal small statements (quips) with minimal effort.

## Isn't this just a Twitter clone then?

Well... Quips was inspired by Twitter's format, but microblogging is the heart and soul for (almost) any social media. This app just takes that format and puts it offline as a journal rather than a social media that everyone can see.

## Building from source

Quips is an app which will never be distributed in TestFlight. You will have to build it with Xcode until GitHub actions publishes builds.

If you have Xcode, you can build Quips from source and run it on your device. The default branch is the only one that is used.

Xcode builds are ran at your own risk and are not guaranteed to get support in the event of an app crash!]

## Planned features

- Image and video attachment support - Once I figure out how this works, it'll be added.
  

## Contribution

If you have issues with the app:

- Describe the issue in detail
- If you have a feature request, please indicate it as so. Planned features are in a different section of the README, so be sure to read those before submitting.
